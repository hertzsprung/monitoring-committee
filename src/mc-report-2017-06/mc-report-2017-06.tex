\section{Introduction}

Numerical weather forecast and climate prediction models are using increasingly fine horizontal meshes to resolve small-scale features and make forecasts more accurate.  Traditionally, atmospheric models have used uniform latitude-longitude meshes to represent a spherical Earth with terrain-following vertical coordinates to represent Earth's terrain, but these representations become problematic with fine horizontal mesh spacing.
First, the cells of latitude-longitude meshes are very small near the Earth's poles, causing a bottleneck in parallel computation \citep{staniforth-thuburn2012} and placing severe time-step constraints on explicit Eulerian methods.
Second, computer storage and computation time increase dramatically when horizontal mesh spacing is reduced uniformly over a latitude-longitude mesh: halving the horizontal mesh spacing results in four times as many cells and simulations require a smaller time-step.
Third, fine horizontal meshes resolve small-scale steep slopes that severely distort terrain-following coordinate surfaces, resulting in larger numerical errors \citep{schaer2002} or even numerical instability \citep{webster2003}.

In response to these problems, a variety of alternative horizontal and vertical representations have been proposed.  Alternative, quasi-uniform meshes avoid small cells near the poles of latitude-longitude meshes \citep{staniforth-thuburn2012}.  Some models are already using quasi-uniform meshes: the German ICON model uses an icosahedral mesh \citep{wan2013}, the Canadian GEM model uses a yin-yang mesh comprising two overlapping sections arranged like a tennis ball \citep{qaddouri2011}, and the UK Met Office are preferring a cubed-sphere mesh for their next-generation Gung-Ho model (Nigel Wood 2017, personal communication).
To improve the scalability of computational resources with finer mesh spacing, static mesh refinement and dynamic adaptive mesh techniques create meshes with fewer cells while retaining the numerical accuracy achieved with a uniformly fine mesh \citep{jablonowski2009}.
mprovements have also been made to the vertical representation over steep terrain.  Mesh distortions are less severe when terrain-following coordinates are smoothed \citep{leuenberger2010,klemp2011}, and cut cell meshes are orthogonal everywhere except at the ground.

These alternative meshes alleviate many of the computational and numerical problems that arise due to finer horizontal mesh spacing, but they introduce problems of their own.
Unlike latitude-longitude meshes, quasi-uniform meshes have non-zero skewness or non-orthogonality that produces grid imprinting errors and excites computational modes \citep{weller2012}.
Mesh refinement and adaptive mesh techniques also create mesh geometries with non-orthogonalities or hanging nodes \citep{marras2016}.
Cut cell meshes are orthogonal nearly everywhere but the cut cell method creates arbitrarily small cells that impose severe time-step constraints on explicit Eulerian methods \citep{klein2009}.

This PhD makes three contributions to improve numerical accuracy on arbitrary meshes.  First, a new mesh for representing steep terrain avoids the severe distortions associated with terrain-following meshes \citep{shaw-weller2016} and avoids severe time-step constraints associated with cut cell meshes \citep{shaw2017}.  Second, a new transport scheme is formulated for numerical stability on high-distorted meshes \citep{shaw2017}.  It is second-order convergent on quasi-uniform spherical meshes, terrain-following and cut cell meshes.
Third, the Charney--Phillips staggering of variables is generalised for arbitrary meshes and is shown to eliminate the computational mode associated with a Lorenz staggering.

The OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics library is used throughout the project to enable like-for-like comparisons.  Different types of mesh are compared using the same model, and different variable staggerings are compared using variants of a single model.
The PhD also contributes two new two-dimensional test cases that are suitable for evaluating dynamical cores.  The first test challenges transport schemes near steeply-sloping lower boundaries \citep{shaw2017}.
The second test is designed to excite the Lorenz computational mode.  Existing tests that excite the Lorenz computational mode are poorly suited to dynamical core evaluation: the standing waves test by \citet{arakawa-konor1996} was designed for a model with no horizontal discretisation, and the radiative heating test by \cite{untch-hortal2004} requires a 600-day integration using a three-dimensional spherical Earth.  The test that we propose requires a 2-day integration using a two-dimensional Cartesian plane and is based on the test by \citet{arakawa-konor1996}.


\section{Advection over steep slopes on arbitrary meshes}
We submitted a manuscript to the Journal of Computational Physics in February 2017 documenting the finite volume transport scheme, ``cubicFit''.  The final article \citep{shaw2017} was made available in April 2017 after one round of minor corrections.  The cubicFit scheme is largely insensitive to mesh distortions and maintains second-order convergence on highly distorted meshes.  Idealised tests demonstrate that the cubicFit scheme is more stable and more accurate than a standard multidimensional linear upwind scheme.

Having presented our work at PDEs on the Sphere in April \href{http://crd.lbl.gov/departments/applied-mathematics/ANAG/about/staff-and-postdocs/hans-johansen/}{Hans Johansen}, a researcher from the computational research group at Lawrence Berkley National Lab, told me that his group have developed a high-order finite volume scheme for solving Poisson's equation on cut cell meshes \citep{devendran2015}.  Hans is keen to help me apply these techniques to the cubicFit transport scheme in order to achieve convergence higher than second-order.  If time permits, I hope to collaborate with Hans to take this work further.

\section{Generalisation of Charney--Phillips for arbitrary meshes}

The Charney--Phillips vertical staggering of variables \citep{charney-phillips1953} is suitable for structured meshes with cells stacked in columns. This staggering has been adopted by several operational models \citep{davies2005,yang2007,girard2014} because it avoids the computational mode that is associated with the Lorenz vertical staggering \citep{arakawa-konor1996}. The generalisation of the Lorenz staggering for unstructured or arbitrarily-structured meshes is straightforward \citep{weller-shahrokhi2014} but this is not true for the Charney--Phillips staggering.

On a finite volume mesh, variables are ordinarily placed at cell centres or cell faces. In the Charney--Phillips staggering, the thermodynamic variable is placed at only those cell faces that lie on vertical coordinate surfaces, and vertically-oriented faces have no thermodynamic information. This arrangement is unsuitable for arbitrarily-structured finite volume meshes because faces can have any orientation.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\input{cp-variables}
	\caption{A quadrilateral cell with the prognostic thermodynamic variable $b_f$ stored at face centres marked by open circles.  $b_f$ is calculated from the potential temperature $\theta_f$ such that $b_f = \theta_f \mathbf{\hat{g}} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}}_f$ where $\mathbf{\hat{n}}_f$ is the unit vector outward normal to face $f$, and $\mathbf{\hat{g}}$ is the unit vector of gravitational acceleration.  The potential temperature at the cell centre, $\theta_C$, is reconstructed from surrounding values of $b_f$ using equation~\eqref{eqn:reconstruct}.}
\label{fig:cp-staggering}
\end{figure}

Work is on schedule to develop a generalisation of the Charney--Phillips staggering of variables.  The prognostic thermodynamic variable $b_f$ is stored at all cell faces such that $b_f = \theta_f \mathbf{\hat{g}} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}}_f$ where $f$ is a face, $\theta_f$ is the potential temperature, $\mathbf{\hat{g}}$ is the unit vector of gravitational acceleration and $\mathbf{\hat{n}}_f$ is the unit vector that is outward normal to the face.
This arrangement is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:cp-staggering}.

To outline the discretisation, let us consider its application to a Cartesian mesh with no diagonal faces.  First, potential temperature is transported in advective form,
\begin{align}
	\theta_f^{n+1} = \theta_f^{\ell} - \Delta t \mathbf{U}_f \cdot \left( \nabla_c \theta_f \right)_F
\end{align}
where $\theta_f^{n+1}$ is the value of $\theta_f$ at the new time-step, $\theta_f^\ell$ is the lagged value from the previous solver iteration, $\mathbf{U}_f$ is the wind, $\left( \cdot \right)_F$ denotes an interpolation from cell centres to faces, and $\nabla_c$ denotes a cell centre gradient \citep{weller-shahrokhi2014}.
Next, $b_f$ is calculated such that $b_f = \theta_f \mathbf{\hat{g}} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}}_f$.  
On a Cartesian mesh, $b_f$ is zero for entirely vertical faces and $b_f = \theta_f$ for entirely horizontal faces.

Where potential temperature is required at the cell centre, it is reconstructed from bordering faces,
\begin{align}
	\theta_C &= \mathbf{\hat{g}} \cdot \left( \sum_{f \in c} \mathbf{\hat{n}}_f \mathbf{S}_f \right)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{f \in c} \mathbf{S}_f b_f \label{eqn:reconstruct}
\end{align}
where $\theta_C$ is the reconstructed potential temperature, $f \in c$ denotes the faces $f$ bordering cell $c$, and $\mathbf{S}_f$ is the vector with magnitude equal to the face area and an outward normal direction.  On a Cartesian mesh, $\theta_C$ is simply a linear interpolation from the face values immediately above and below the cell centre.

Finally, $\theta_f$ is recalculated from $b_f$ and $\theta_C$,
\begin{align}
	\theta_f = \lvert \mathbf{\hat{g}} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}}_f \theta_f \rvert + \left( 1 - \lvert \mathbf{\hat{g}} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} \rvert \right) \left( \theta_C \right)_F \text{.}
\end{align}
This ensures that values of $\theta_f$ on vertical faces is calculated from nearby $b_f$ values and is not retained across time-steps.
We have created a new variant of the nonhydrostatic model by \citet{weller-shahrokhi2014} that implements this generalised Charney--Phillips formulation.

We have also created a new two-dimensional vertical slice test case that we use to compare the Lorenz and generalised Charney--Phillips model variants.
The new test case is based on the standing waves test by \citet{arakawa-konor1996}, which was designed for a vertically discrete model with no horizontal discretisation.
Grid-scale potential temperature perturbations are added to an isothermal atmosphere in hydrostatic balance (figure~\ref{fig:waves-initial}).  The details of the test configuration have yet to be finalised.

After a two day integration, preliminary results using the Lorenz model show a spurious grid-scale oscillation occupying the entire depth of the domain, having propagated upwards from the position of the initial perturbation (figure~\ref{fig:waves-lorenz}).  This grid-scale error indicates that the Lorenz computational mode has been excited.  No such error is found with the generalised Charney--Phillips model (figure~\ref{fig:waves-cp}).

Initially, grid-scale perturbations with a maximum amplitude of $\pm \SI{0.5}{\kelvin}$ are added in the centre of the domain near the ground.  These perturbations generate gravity waves that spread through the domain.  A spurious grid-scale oscillation indicates that the Lorenz computational mode is excited using the Lorenz model.  No such error is present using the generalised Charney--Phillips model.
Only the central part of the domain is shown with cell edges marked by grey lines.

\section{Future research}

I have completed tasks up to May 2017 according to the schedule set out in \href{http://www.datumedge.co.uk/publications/mc-report-2016-11.pdf}{monitoring committee report \#4} and we are making good progress generalising Charney--Phillips.  My supervisors and I are keen to develop this work into a third article to be submitted to the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, and I believe a third publication will benefit a future academic career.

With the agreement of the monitoring committee, I would like to apply for a six-month extension for the completion of my PhD.  This extension application is based on a number of grounds.
First, as of May 2017, I have spent a total of five months addressing reviewer comments: designing new mesh generation techniques, performing new experiments and revising manuscripts (Appendix C).
Second, I expect to spend about two months writing a third journal article.
Third, my second article supercedes parts of my first article.  As such, a one-to-one mapping between articles and thesis chapters in all instances, and reorganisation, new prose and new figures will be required for the thesis.
Finally, I have completed two masters modules, one of which was assessed.

\subsection*{Timeline of future work}

I intend to interleave the writing of my thesis with technical work on generalised Charney--Phillips.  Chapters 5 and 6 will be largely copied from the third manuscript.

\end{description}


\section{Personal development}

Since the last monitoring committee meeting in November 2016 I have been invited to speak at the RMetS south-east meeting at the University of Reading, and at a numerical methods workshop at Imperial College.  I am helping to organise the NERC student conference, lead by students from NERC DTPs in London, and I have applied to present at SciCADE, a conference on scientific computation and differential equations.

I am now considering my options for future employment, and I am keen to continue research in numerical methods, either applied to weather and climate modelling or other disciplines.
Hilary has kindly introduced me to a number of colleagues in UK institutions and I am following up with those who may have positions opening soon.

I am also interested other academic roles that promote good practices in reproducible science and research software engineering.
I have applied for a 10-month Mozilla science fellowship that supports researchers wanting to promote open science within their institution.
The international programme selects four fellows each year, with this year's fellows being chosen in June 2017.
Mozilla allow fellows to spend 20\% of their time on their own research and so, should I be chosen, I would need to work on my PhD part-time and postpone the completion date for 8 months.

If I cannot find a suitable academic job I am considering computational fluid dynamics positions and software engineering positions elsewhere.
I submitted an application in May to the UK Met Office who have several software engineering vacancies.
