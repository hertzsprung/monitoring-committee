- Teaching
  / teaching MPECDT
  / cosupervision of Weller's MSc student
    / learning about dimension split advection schemes, constancy, new test cases
    / perhaps eventually compare with multidimensional scheme
  / Brighton outreach
  / East Reading festival
/ SCENARIO conference
/ ECMWF training
/ Hoskins@70
/ project state at end of MSc:
  / horizontal tracer advection (schaer2002)
  / stratified atmosphere initially at rest (klemp2011)
  / gravity waves (schaer2002/melvin2010)
  / two newly formulated advection tests with terrain-following velocity field with different tracer profiles
/ project work since start of PhD:
  / advection improvements including
    / calculating correct analytic solution to terrain-following advection
    / writing new advection equation solver
    / making wind field non-divergent
  / MWR paper of comparison of TF and cut cell grids
    / key findings: advection accurate when flow aligned with grid, Lorenz computational mode in orographically induced gravity waves
/ small side projects to further learning
  / discrete div/curl formulations on primal/dual meshes
  / Euler, Heun and RK timestepping methods for ODEs
  / mathematical equivalence of TF coords/FVM
- potential next steps
  / C--P staggering (including further motivation)
  / TF/cut cell blend
  / 3D
  / large/global scale, coriolis forces
