\section{Introduction}

\section{Generalising the Charney--Phillips staggering for arbitrary meshes}

\href{http://www.datumedge.co.uk/publications/mc-report-2017-06.pdf}{Monitoring committee report \#5} presented results of a new test case designed to excite the Lorenz computational mode.  A fully-compressible Euler model included a newly-formulated generalisation of the Charney--Phillips staggering for arbitrary meshes.
Unlike the model with Lorenz staggering, the Lorenz computational mode was not present in the new Charney--Phillips model.
These results were obtained on a uniform mesh using a low-accuracy advective-form scheme for transporting potential temperature.  We set out to design a more accurate transport scheme and perform tests using distorted meshes in order to exercise the generalised Charney--Phillips staggering more thoroughly.

}

% however, I've been unable to concoct a more accurate transport scheme, and the low-accuracy scheme produces bad results on distorted meshes
% advective form is non-conservative and this has spoiled test results
% but not obvious how to formulate a flux-form scheme, and would require averaging of winds, too
% I'll write up what we've achieved so far in the thesis (but not into a paper)
% but I don't want to spend further time on C--P because it looks like a dead end
% instead, I want to pursue work on highOrderFit, which has already been successful in 1D

\section{High-order transport for arbitrary meshes}

The cubicFit transport scheme solves the transport equation by approximating fluxes through faces using a multidimensional polynomial reconstruction \citep{shaw2017}.
The reconstruction fits a polynomial over known values stored at cell centre points, and this point-wise approach limits the cubicFit scheme to second-order convergence.
\citet{devendran2017} have developed a high-order finite volume scheme for solving Poisson's equation, and we apply their approach to obtain a transport scheme with high-order convergence.
Since it has much in common with the cubicFit scheme, we name this high-order scheme `highOrderFit'. 

Instead of a point-wise reconstruction that uses cell centre positions, the highOrderFit scheme constrains the polynomial fit so that the average of the polynomial integrated over a cell volume equals the cell average value.
Applying this constraint to each cell in the reconstruction stencil produces an overdetermined linear system that is solved using a weighted least squares approach in a similar manner to the cubicFit scheme \citep{shaw2017}.
Since we use the same reconstruction stencil, the highOrderFit scheme has the same computational cost per time-stage as the cubicFit scheme.

	\caption{One-dimensional fluxes through a cell $\phi_{j+1}$ using four-point upwind-biased stencils to approximate fluxes $\phi_L$ and $\phi_R$.}
	\label{fig:1d-stencil}
\end{figure}

In one dimension, the reconstruction stencil comprises three upwind cells and one downwind cell.
Every cell has a left and right face, each with its own four-point stencil (figure~\ref{fig:1d-stencil}).
Hence, assuming a suitably high-order time-stepping scheme, highOrderFit should achieve fourth-order convergence because the flux divergence is approximated with five points.

We verify that highOrderFit achieves fourth-order convergence using a simple one-dimensional transport test.  The periodic domain is defined over the interval $[0,1]$ with a uniform velocity field $u = 1$ and an initial tracer field $\phi$ being defined as
\begin{align}
	\phi(x) = \exp \left( -b \left( x - x_0 \right)^2 \right)
\end{align}
where the Gaussian hill is centred at $x_0 = 0.5$ with $b = 80$.

Since we are interested in achieving high-order convergence on arbitrary meshes, the one-dimensional domain is divided into $N$ unequal intervals such that $\Delta x_i, \: i = 1\isep N$ becomes gradually coarser with increasing $i$.  The nonuniform mesh is smooth except for a discontinuity between $\Delta x_1$ and $\Delta x_N$ at the periodic boundary.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{tracer}
	\caption{One-dimensional transport of a Gaussian hill across a periodic domain using the highOrderFit scheme.  The initial tracer is transported in a uniform velocity field exactly once around the domain so that the analytic solution is equal to the initial solution marked by a dotted line.  The numerical solution is marked by a solid line and cell centre averages are marked by crosses.}
	\label{fig:advect1D-tracer}
\end{figure}

The test is integrated forward by one time unit such that the tracer is transported exactly once around the periodic domain such that the analytic solution is equal to the initial solution.  A solution on a rather coarse mesh with $N = 32$ is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:advect1D-tracer} with the initial solution marked by a dotted line and the final numerical solution marked by a solid line, with cell centre averages marked by crosses.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{convergence}
	\caption{Convergence of the cubicFit and highOrderFit schemes in the one-dimensional transport test.
	The error norms are defined as $\ell_2 = \left( \sum \left( \left( \phi - \phi_T \right)^2 \Delta x \right) / \sum \left( \phi_T^2 \Delta x \right)\right)^{1/2}$ and $\ell_\infty = \max \left| \phi - \phi_T \right| / \max \left| \phi_T \right|$ where $\phi$ is the numerical solution and $\phi_T$ is the analytic solution.}
	\label{fig:advect1D-convergence}
\end{figure}

Convergence tests are performed comparing cubicFit and highOrderFit transport schemes using meshes with cell counts between $N = 2^4$ and $N = 2^8$.  The classical fourth-order Runge--Kutta time-stepping scheme \citep[p. 53]{durran2013} is used for both transport schemes.  The cubicFit scheme is limited to second-order convergence while the highOrderFit scheme is fourth-order convergent (figure~\ref{fig:advect1D-convergence}).

\section{Future research}

% Generalisation of Charney--Phillips staggering not going so well
% but high-order transport scheme going much better

\section{Personal development}

I continue to give regular talks at group meetings and I have arranged to give a lunchtime seminar in January 2018.
I have also been invited by \href{http://staff.southwales.ac.uk/users/8005-jkent}{James Kent} to speak at a mathematics departmental seminar at University of South Wales where Dr Kent lectures.

I also continue searching for postdoctoral vacancies.
I was unsuccessful in my application for a Mozilla science fellowship, though I was very happy to be placed amongst the top 5\% of more than 1000 applicants.
I was offered a position as a scientific software engineer at the Met Office, but chose to decline since the role was focused on software development with few opportunities for scientific research.
I was also interviewed for a postdoctoral position developing numerical methods for flood forecasts at the University of Sheffield, but the position was given to a more experienced candidate.

I have worked with David Dritschel at the University of St Andrews and Alan Blyth, Doug Parker and Steven B\"{o}ing at the University of Leeds to submit an EPSRC proposal that extends the Moist Parcel-in-a-Cell model \citep{boeing2017} for studying cloud turbulence.  We expect the EPSRC to reach a decision around March 2018.
I am also a named postdoctoral researcher on a NERC proposal to study physics-dynamics coupling that Hilary submitted in collaboration with Jemma Shipton, Colin Cotter, Peter Clark and John Thuburn in July 2017.
\TODO{what happens next to the NERC proposal?}
I continue to monitor job boards for new vacancies.
