\maketitle

Numerical weather forecast and climate prediction models are using increasingly fine horizontal meshes to resolve small-scale features and make forecasts more accurate.  Traditionally, atmospheric models have used uniform latitude-longitude meshes to represent a spherical Earth with terrain-following vertical coordinates to represent Earth's terrain, but these representations become problematic with fine horizontal mesh spacing.
First, the cells of latitude-longitude meshes become increasingly small near the Earth's poles, causing a bottleneck in parallel computation and placing severe time-step constraints on explicit Eulerian methods \TODO{citations}.
Second, computer storage and computation time increase dramatically when horizontal mesh spacing is reduced uniformly over a latitude-longitude mesh: halving the horizontal mesh spacing results in four times as many cells and simulations require a smaller time-step.
Third, fine horizontal meshes resolve small-scale steep slopes that severely distort terrain-following coordinate surfaces, resulting in larger numerical errors or even numerical instabilities \TODO{citations}.

In response to these problems, a variety of alternative horizontal and vertical representations have been proposed.  Alternative, quasi-uniform meshes avoid small cells near the poles of latitude-longitude meshes \citep{staniforth-thuburn2012}.  Some operational models are already using quasi-uniform meshes: the German ICON model uses an icosahedral mesh \citep{wan2013}, the Canadian GEM model uses a yin-yang mesh comprising two overlapping sections arranged like a tennis ball \citep{qaddouri2011}, and the UK Met Office are preferring a cubed-sphere mesh for their next-generation Gung-Ho model \TODO{citation}.
To improve the scalability of computational resources with finer mesh spacing, static mesh refinement \TODO{cite}, dynamic mesh adaptivity \TODO{cite} or moving mesh techniques \TODO{cite} create meshes with fewer cells while retaining numerical accuracy.
Improvements have also been made to the vertical representation over steep terrain.  Mesh distortions are less severe when terrain-following coordinates are smoothed \citep{leuenberger2010,klemp2011}, and cut cell meshes are orthogonal everywhere except at the ground \TODO{citation}.

These alternative meshes alleviate many of the computational and numerical problems that arise due to finer horizontal mesh spacing, but they introduce problems of their own.
Unlike latitude-longitude meshes that are everywhere orthogonal, quasi-uniform meshes can produce grid imprinting errors and excite computational modes \citep{weller2012}.
Mesh refinement, mesh adaptivity and moving mesh techniques also create mesh geometries with non-orthogonalities or hanging nodes \TODO{cite?}.
Cut cell meshes are orthogonal nearly everywhere but the cut cell method creates arbitrarily small cells that impose severe time-step constraints on explicit Eulerian methods \citep{klein2009}.

This PhD makes three contributions to improve numerical accuracy on arbitrary meshes.  First, a new mesh for representing steep terrain avoids the severe distortions associated with terrain-following meshes and avoids severe time-step constraints associated with cut cell meshes.  Second, a new advection scheme is formulated for numerical stability on high-distorted meshes.  It is second-order convergent on quasi-uniform spherical meshes, terrain-following and cut cell meshes.
Third, the Charney--Phillips staggering of variables is generalised for arbitrary meshes and is shown to eliminate the computational mode associated with the Lorenz staggering.

The OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics library is used throughout the project to enable like-for-like comparisons.  Different meshes are compared using the same model, and different variable staggerings are compared using variants of a single model.
The PhD also contributes two new two-dimensional test cases that are suitable for evaluating dynamical cores.  The first test challenges advection schemes near steeply-sloping lower boundaries.  The second two-dimensional test is designed to excite the Lorenz computational mode and is based on the one-dimensional standing waves case of \citet{arakawa-konor1996}.

\subsection*{Appendix A: Thesis plan}
The thesis chapters are expected to be as follows:

\subsubsection*{Existing methodologies}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1em]
	\item Describe Lorenz and Charney--Phillips staggerings for structured quadrilateral meshes
	\item Describe the nonhydrostatic finite volume model with Lorenz staggering for arbitrary meshes \citep{weller-shahrokhi2014}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{A new mesh for representing terrain}
\noindent The slanted cell mesh improves pressure gradient accuracy and avoids severe timestep constraints for explicit methods.
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1em]
	\item Introduce existing types of mesh: terrain-following layers and cut cells
	\item Describe the new slanted cell method
	\item {Two-dimensional test results comparing terrain-following, cut cell and slanted cell meshes
	\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1em,topsep=0pt]
		\item Maximum stable timesteps in a prescribed wind field (depends on the mesh geometry only)
		\item A test of a quiescent atmosphere above steep slopes (using the linearUpwind scheme?)
	\end{itemize}}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{A new transport scheme for steep slopes}
\noindent The cubicFit transport scheme is stable and accurate over steep slopes with arbitrary, distorted meshes.
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1em]
	\item Document the cubicFit transport scheme
	\item {Test results comparing linearUpwind and cubicFit transport schemes
	\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1em,topsep=0pt]
		\item Two-dimensional transport test over steep slopes, as presented in this report
		\item \citet{lauritzen2012} deformational transport tests on a spherical Earth
		\item \citet{schaer2002} mountain waves test case (should demonstrate that cubicFit is necessary to obtain the reference solution)
	\end{itemize}}
\end{itemize}
	
\subsubsection*{A generalisation of the Charney--Phillips staggering}
\noindent The Charney--Phillips staggering avoids the Lorenz computational mode, but it has only been formulated for structured quadrilateral meshes.  A generalised formulation will be suitable for arbitrary meshes, including the slanted cell mesh.
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1em]
	\item Describe the generalised Charney--Phillips formulation
	\item Describe its implementation into the nonhydrostatic model of \citet{weller-shahrokhi2014}
	\item One or two tests that excite the Lorenz computational mode; compare results between the Lorenz and Charney--Phillips variants of the model
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Possible chapter: grid-scale perturbations and diabatic heating over orography}
\noindent We should demonstrate the efficacy of combining all three work items: the slanted cell mesh, the cubicFit transport scheme, and the generalised Charney--Phillips formulation.  In order to achieve this, we may be able to introduce orography into the two-dimensional idealised simulations of \citet{arakawa-konor1996}.
Results should be compared between Lorenz and Charney--Phillips model variants.  Results could also be compared between mesh types, or results could be compared using the cubicFit and linearUpwind transport schemes.
